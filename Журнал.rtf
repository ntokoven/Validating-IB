Train encoder fully until initial network achieves 100% accuracy\
Then either maximise/minimise the lower/upper bound on mutual information to get the real value of it - both for input and output\
evaluate each encoding depending on the number of samples (z;y) available\
Read 1 paper each day in the morning\
At the end of each week save all the code for build models in .py files\
